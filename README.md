## Outline for Sublime Text 3

### Overview

Inspired by [FileBrowser](https://github.com/aziz/SublimeFileBrowser), this package shows the outline/structure of your code/document in a sidebar-style tab.

### Default layout

The outline tab can be set as a sidebar on the left or right. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and select either `Browse Mode: Outline (Left)` or `Browse Mode: Outline (Right)` to set your preferred layout.

If you also use [FileBrowser](https://github.com/aziz/SublimeFileBrowser), you can use both in three different layouts:

* `FileBrowser` left, `Outline` right
* `FileBrowser` top left, `Outline` bottom left
* `FileBrowser` top right, `Outline` bottom right

To use `FileBrowser` and `Outline` together, please close the `FileBrowser` sidebar first and then use the correponding `Browse Mode` command to set the layout, otherwise the `Outline` view may not work as intended.

### Outline content and identation

Outline is updated when you save a file or switch between files.

Content and identation in the `Outline` tab is controlled by the `Symbol List.tmPreferences` file (file name may differ) corresponding to the syntax of your file.

### Known issue

* This package may not work if you use a multi-column/row layout.
